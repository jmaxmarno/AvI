*   Segment Everything at first
*   Repair image links in readme
*   Need to clarify terminology used
    *   This will be done in the ‘story’ view
    *   Attribute description
    *   Legend in multiple places (story view, and adjacent to area chart)
*   Ability to select non-continuous time range?
    *   This would be good to be able to select multiple ‘years’ that are not continuous for comparison
    *   Start with continuous only first, then add non-continuous optional
*   Could use a linear colormap for quantitative attributes (elevation, size)
    *   We are binning these to view proportions, so might not work as well
*   Optional - link to UAC website for selected time range
*   Would it be better to split out the human involvement attributes? Or one for all? Ie buried, caught, carried, etc...
    *   Probably split out still
*   Could use a ‘tree ring’ style for the optional ‘yearclock’ view
*   Need to highlight the difference between our dataset of observed occurrences, and the ‘real’ world
    *   This will be accomplished through our story telling, as well as choice of attribute manipulation (proportions and absolute counts)
*   Could use lines/marks to connect focus area to adjacent stream graph. To highlight that it is a ‘continuous view’ over time
*   Could visualize the attribute proportions of the whole, while showing the observation counts on hover/tooltip
    *   Maybe show observation counts within each cell of yearmonth grid
*   A map/geovis might be a nice supplement
*   Use some chart junk, ‘avalanche’ theme. 
    *   Or maybe UAC color theme?
    *   Draw users in
*   For yearmonth grid brush selection, include functionality to drag and resize the brush
*   Definitely needs a master ‘reset’ button
    *   Would this basically be ‘refresh’??
